# Payload Code Block Feature

This package embeds `@lexical/code` in the editor in PayloadCMS and is not intended to produce long-term functionality for PayloadCMS. Most likely, the Code Block feature will be included in the `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` package, and this package comes as a solution for people who want the functionality but can't wait for an official variant.

Therefore, this package will not have new features in the future, nor automated tests.
